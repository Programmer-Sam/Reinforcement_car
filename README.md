Reinforcement Learning Car Environment Project

Watch the result of my programme here: https://youtu.be/HyHeBK7nDUE

If you would like to run the code personally, you may download the 'Q-tables' file and 'Run.py' (make sure these are stored in the same place). You can then run the python file, which will use several python libraries (ensure they are downloaded).

You may personally train the programme by downloading the 'envModule', 'agent module train' and 'agent greedy module':
  1)run the agent module train
  2)this will give you information while its running and saves q-tables
  3)you may then run the agent module train (ensure you change the variable named "load" to direct the file number you would like to use
Unfortunately, this will mainly be accessible to those who have a knowledge of coding. 

I have yet to create a user interface for this programme so this may not be accessible to everyone!
